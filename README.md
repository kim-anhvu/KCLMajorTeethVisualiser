# KCLMajorTeethVisualiser

A desktop application that allows users to visualise radiation on the teeth.

# Build and Run:
<pre>
1. Download and install the Unity Editor from: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download (we used version 2018.3.5f1 but a newer vesion should also be fine)

2. Open the 'Teeth Visualizer' directory with the editor as a new project.

3. Go to File > Build Settings > Choose 'PC, Mac & Linux Standalone', make sure you have selected your architecture (x32 or x64) in case you have that option (no offense Mac users :) )

4. Make sure no development flags are set

5. Make sure the Scenes Scenes/SampleScene and Scenes/GraphScene have been selected

6. Click build.

7. Select the folder in which you want all the files to be generated in

8. After everything has been generated, add the sample data csv ('data.csv') to the same directory in which the executable lives

9. Run the executable and enjoy!

(Just in case, a Windows build will be included in the delivarable if you're to lazy to go through the prcess yourself :) )
